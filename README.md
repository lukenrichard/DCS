This project uses a Material-UI Card to display information about a User. The information of the User is gathered from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1.
The app is run using the command "npm start", which will open up a page in localhost:3000 that will display the Card with the User information.

The majority of the time spent on this project was formatting the card, as I have only used Material-UI once previously. I was able to use and implement the other technologies
easily as I have previous experience with them.

I have spent more time on 15FEB2020 working on changes to ensure that only MUI CSS in JS styling was used, as well as moving the the Card Component into a seperate folder and using conditional rendering to only save one state for User information.
